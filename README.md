# Facedancer 3.0

This repository houses the next generation of Facedancer software. Descended from
the original GoodFET-based Facedancer, this repository provides a python module
that provides expanded Facedancer support -- including support for multiple boards
and some pretty significant new features.


## Installation

Install this package with the following command:

    pip install facedancer

After that you can import the facedancer package as usual:

    $ python
    >>> import facedancer


## Where are my scripts?

Facedancer 3.0 is a ground-up rewrite of the original emulation core
and does not support legacy scripts.

If you're using scripts or training materials that depend on features
or APIs deprecated in `v3.0.x` you can install the latest `v2.9.x`
release of Facedancer with:

    pip install "facedancer<=3"

Legacy applets and examples can be found in the [`v2.9.x`](https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/facedancer/tree/v2.9.x)
branch.


## What is a Facedancer?

Facedancer boards are simple hardware devices that act as "remote-controlled" USB
controllers. With the proper software, you can use these boards to quickly and
easily emulate USB devices -- and to fuzz USB host controllers!

This particular software repository currently allows you to easily create emulations
of USB devices in Python. Control is fine-grained enough that you can cause all
kinds of USB misbehaviors. :)

 * [The Facedancer 21, the original supported board](http://goodfet.sourceforge.net/hardware/facedancer21/)

## USBProxy 'Nouveau' and Protocol Analysis

A major new feature of the newer Facedancer codebase is the ability to MITM (Meddler-In-The-Middle) USB connections -- replacing one of the authors' original [USBProxy](https://github.com/dominicgs/usbproxy)
project. This opens up a whole new realm of applications -- including protocol analysis
and live manipulation of USB packets -- and is especially useful when you don't control
the software running on the target device (e.g. on embedded systems or games consoles).

This feature is complete, but could use more documentation. Pull requests are welcome. :)


## How do I use this repository?

First, you'll likely want to set the ```BACKEND``` environment variable, which lets
the software know which type of Facedancer board you'd like to use. If this variable
isn't set, the software will try to guess for you based on what's connected. It doesn't
always make the best guesses, so you're probably better off setting it yourself.

Next, you'll probably want to check out one of the examples, or one of the pre-made scripts.
Examples in the new syntax are located under `examples`. The core Facedancer scripts in the
"old" syntax are located in `legacy-applets`.

For example:

```sh
export BACKEND=greatfet
./examples/rubber-ducky.py
```

## What boards are currently supported?

 * The [Cynthion USB Test Instrument](http://greatscottgadgets.com/cynthion/) (```BACKEND=cynthion```)
 * The [GreatFET One](http://greatscottgadgets.com/greatfet/) (```BACKEND=greatfet```)
 * The NXP LPC4330 Xplorer board. (```BACKEND=greatfet```)
 * The CCCamp 2015 rad1o badge with GreatFET l0adable (```BACKEND=greatfet```)
 * All GoodFET-based Facedancers, including the common Facedancer21 (```BACKEND=goodfet```)
 * RPi + Max3241 Raspdancer boards (```BACKEND=raspdancer```)
 * HydraDancer and HydraUSB3 boards (```BACKEND=hydradancer```)
 * Any Linux board with [Raw Gadget](https://github.com/xairy/raw-gadget) support (```BACKEND=rawgadget```)

Note that hardware restrictions prevent the MAX3420/MAX3421 boards from emulating
more complex devices -- there's limitation on the number/type of endpoints that can be
set up. The LPC4330 boards -- such as the GreatFET -- have fewer limitations.

For a similar reason, the MAX3420/MAX3421 boards (`BACKEND=goodfet` or `BACKEND=raspdancer`)
currently cannot be used as USBProxy-nv MITM devices. All modern boards (`BACKEND=greatfet`, `BACKEND=hydradancer`)
should be fully functional.

Note that the HydraDancer and HydraUSB3 boards (`BACKEND=hydradancer`) do not currently support host-mode.
Note actual FaceDancer 3.0 does not work on Windows(some issues in pyusb...) and only GNU/Linux

## What boards could be supported soon?

 * Anything supporting USB-over-IP.

## What features do you plan on adding?

The roadmap is under development, but in addition to multi-board support, this repository
will eventually be home to some cool new features, including:

 * High-speed ("USB 2.0") device emulation on devices with USB 2.0 PHYs.
 * On-the-fly generation of USB device controllers in gateware.

## Whose fault _is_ this?

There are a lot of people to blame for the awesomeness that is this repo,
including:

 * Kate Temkin (@ktemkin)
 * Travis Goodspeed (@travisgoodspeed)
 * Sergey Bratus (@sergeybratus)
 * Dominic Spill (@dominicgs)
 * Michael Ossmann (@michaelossmann)
 * Mikaela Szekely (@Qyriad)
 * anyone whose name appears in the git history :)
